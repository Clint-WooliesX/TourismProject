            Wiseman’s Ferry is the oldest ferry crossing still in operation in
            New South Wales. The river settlement of Wiseman’s Ferry is located
            in the heart of the Hawkesbury River around 60 kilometres north-west
            of Sydney CBD. Surrounded by beautiful national parks Wisemans Ferry
            is a rustic village on one of Australia’s most famous waterways.
            Take one of the two ferries available across the sparkling
            Hawkesbury River to explore St Albans, the Hunter Valley and
            Gosford.

            Filled with Aboriginal and European history, the area’s heritage
            shops and famous pub is a great spot to relax on a getaway from the
            city. The nearby Dharug National Park contains 16 kilometres of the
            convict-built Old Great North Road that once connected Sydney and
            Newcastle. Visitors can walk the first 1.6 kilometre section of the
            old road, or stroll along the 1.6 kilometre Grass Tree Circuit - a
            good walk for families – or picnic at Mill Creek or Hazel Dell. The
            park is also a popular destination for mountain biking (bikes must
            be walked up Devines Hill), while car-based and small-caravan
            camping is available at Mill Creek. Backpack camping is permitted at
            Ten Mile Hollow.
