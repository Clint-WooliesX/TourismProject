        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p><img src="/images/ferry.jpeg" alt="" class="float-right">
          Wiseman’s Ferry is the oldest ferry crossing still in operation in New
          South Wales. The river settlement of Wiseman’s Ferry is located in the
          heart of the Hawkesbury River around 60 kilometres north-west of
          Sydney CBD. Surrounded by beautiful national parks Wisemans Ferry is a
          rustic village on one of Australia’s most famous waterways. Take one
          of the two ferries available across the sparkling Hawkesbury River to
          explore St Albans, the Hunter Valley and Gosford.

          Filled with Aboriginal and European history, the area’s heritage shops and famous pub is a great spot to relax on a getaway from the city. The nearby Dharug National Park contains 16 kilometres of the convict-built Old Great North Road that once connected Sydney and Newcastle. Visitors can walk the first 1.6 kilometre section of the old road, or stroll along the 1.6 kilometre Grass Tree Circuit - a good walk for families – or picnic at Mill Creek or Hazel Dell. The park is also a popular destination for mountain biking (bikes must be walked up Devines Hill), while car-based and small-caravan camping is available at Mill Creek. Backpack camping is permitted at Ten Mile Hollow.</p>
